      "description": "Avicennia marina, commonly known as the grey mangrove, is a salt-tolerant mangrove species found in coastal and estuarine environments. It is known for its ability to thrive in high-salinity conditions by excreting excess salt through its leaves. This species has unique aerial roots, called pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air, making it well adapted to waterlogged and anoxic soils. The grey mangrove provides crucial habitat and food for marine and terrestrial species, playing an essential role in coastal ecosystem protection and stabilization.",

It is recognized for its high tolerance to saline environments and can often be found in the upper tidal zones. The tree has smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, leathery leaves that store water to withstand dry conditions. It produces elongated propagules that can float and establish themselves in new locations, contributing to the expansion of mangrove forests. This species is vital for coastal stabilization, carbon sequestration, and supporting biodiversity.",
